      For a landlord to be added to the Watch List, they must own a building with fewer than 35 units with an average of at least three open, serious violations (B and C violations) per unit. Larger buildings must have an average of at least two open, serious violations (B and C violations) per unit.
      
      According to HPD, violations reflect information on three classes of housing code violations:
      
      Class A: Non-hazardous violations, such as minor leaks or lack of signs designating floor numbers. An owner has 90 days to correct an A violation and two weeks to certify repair to remove the violation.
       
      Class B: Hazardous violations, such as requiring public doors to be self-closing, adequate lighting in public areas, lack of posted Certificate of Occupancy, or removal of vermin. An owner has 30 days to correct a B violation and two weeks to certify the correction to remove the violation.
       
      Class C: Immediately hazardous violations, such as inadequate fire exits, rodents, lead-based paint, lack of heat, hot water, electricity, or gas. An owner has 24 hours to correct a C violation and five days to certify the correction to remove the violation. If the owner fails to comply with emergency C violations such as lack of heat or hot water, HPD initiates corrective action through its Emergency Repair Program.
       
      Class I: Violations for which there is an order from a judge to correct a violation. This category also applies if the building is in the Alternative Enforcement Program or an order to vacate exists.',

      The Public Advocate\'s Office will remove landlords from the Watch List after a sufficient number of violations have been resolved with HPD to place them below the Watch List\'s qualifying criteria. The site is updated every two weeks based on available HPD data.
      
      In order to remove your name from the Watch List you must resolve your open violations with HPD. If you have resolved violations or you believe that the information provided by HPD is not up-to-date, you can request to be removed from the list by contacting Tom Gray at (212) 669-7200. Our office will then follow up with HPD to verify that the violations have been corrected and remove your building from the Watch List. We will only remove the building when HPD confirms that a sufficient number of violations have been resolved to place the building below the Watch List’s qualifying criteria.
      
      Resources for resolving these violations can be found below.
      
      Article 8A Loan Program 
      
      Article 8A Loans are generally limited to the upgrading or replacement of major building systems with an emphasis on energy items. In general, loans cannot exceed the actual cost of rehabilitation. Loans are available in amounts of up to $35,000 per dwelling unit with no maximum per building, subject to the availability of funds. Building condition and finances must demonstrate a need for funds, and owners must be unable to obtain financing privately. The interest rate is 3% with repayment in equal monthly installments and there is a prepayment surcharge within the first five years of the loan. The term of the loan may not exceed 30 years or the useful life of the improvements, whichever is less. There is a non-refundable application fee of $150.00 and a commitment fee equal to one (1%) of the loan amount payable at closing, plus a 1/2% legal fee. To learn more, contact program director Anna Frantz at HPD: (212)-863-8229.
      
      Preservation Participation Loan Program (PLP) 
      
      HPD’s Preservation Participation Loan Program (“PLP”) was created to provide low-interest loans to private residential building owners for the moderate or substantial rehabilitation of housing for low-to-moderate income households. The program operates in conjunction with a group of pre-qualified participating lenders identified on the PLP Term Sheet found below. Borrowers are free to work with the participating lender of their choice. HPD provides 2nd mortgages in the form of City Capital or Federal HOME funds. Combined with bank or tax-exempt bond financing, the blended financing cost is below the market rate. Projects may be eligible to apply in HPD’s competitive rounds of the Federal Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and other sources of financing. HPD and the lenders collaborate in underwriting the loan, and all projects must meet HPD’s design and construction standards. Projects are encouraged to apply for and utilize other funding sources, such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) and funds from the New York State Department of Housing and Community Renewal. During construction and after rehabilitation, real property taxes may be eligible for abatement. Allowable income levels and rents depend on the type of subsidy used and on the existing affordability restrictions already in place. Buildings are subject to affordability and use restrictions through a 30-year Regulatory Agreement and following rehabilitation all units are registered in the New York State Rent Stabilization system. To learn more, contact program director Chris Dewees at HPD: (212)-863-6408.
      
      Small Owner Repair Program (SORP)
      
      HPD’s Small Owner Repair Program provides funding for limited systems replacement and other key repairs in privately-owned multiple dwelling properties. Since participating owners often lack the resources to address building-wide problems, repair work done through the program addresses specific critical issues rather than general rehabilitation. The program provides a 10-year forgivable loan up to $10,000 per dwelling unit for buildings of three to 20 units.  In exchange for this forgivable loan, owners will enter into a 10-year regulatory agreement with the City to ensure the financial viability, physical upkeep, and continued affordability of participating buildings. Tenant incomes must adhere to Federal income guidelines and rent limits apply. For more information about eligibility and terms, please download the SORP Term Sheet click here or contact Elizabeth Mercado, Program Director, at: (212) 863-6337.

    'body' => 'As a tenant in New York City you have the right to a safe, decent home. That means you are entitled to basic services needed to live comfortably throughout every season and that your landlord has a legal duty to provide them.
       
      Heat & Hot Water
      Building owners are legally required to provide heat during the winter season (from October 1st through May 31st) and hot water year-round.
       
      Duty to Repair
      Landlords must keep the apartments and the building’s public areas in “good repair” and clean and free of vermin, garbage or other offensive material. Landlords are required to maintain electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating and ventilating systems and appliances landlords install, such as refrigerators and stoves, in good and safe working order. Landlords are also required to install functioning smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in all apartments.
       
      Lead Paint
      Lead paint can be a severe health hazard to you and your family. As a result, it is your landlord’s duty to ensure that your apartment is clear of lead paint hazards. In performing any work that disturbs lead paint in applicable apartments and common areas, a landlord must hire workers who have completed a training course in lead-safe work practices. Landlords must remove or permanently cover apartment walls and other areas where lead based paint is peeling. Landlords must keep records of all notices, inspections, and repairs of lead paint hazards and   provide every tenant with an informational pamphlet from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
       
      Entering Your Home & Unlawful Eviction
      In general in New York City, a landlord may only enter a tenant’s apartment for three reasons: emergency repairs, non-emergency repairs or improvements, andapartment inspections. Emergency repair requires no advance notice to the tenant.However, access for non-emergency repairs and improvements requires a minimum ofone week’s advance written notice, and access for inspection requires a minimum of 24hours advance written notice.
       
      A landlord may not evict a tenant from his or her apartment without a proper warrant of eviction. If the landlord changes the locks to your apartment and does not provide you with a new key, it is considered an unlawful eviction and should be reported to your local police precinct or brought to the New York City Housing Court. For more information: http://www.courts.state.ny.us/courts/nyc/housing/illegal.shtml
       
      Reporting a Problem in Your Apartment
      New York City tenants are entitled to safe, decent housing. Their landlords, in turn, are required by law to provide the basic essential services that tenants need to live comfortably. If a landlord fails to provide such services or to repair poor living conditions, a tenant may report the problem to the City\'s Citizen Service Center by calling 311 (311 can be accessed outside of New York City by dialing (212) NEW YORK). For the hearing impaired, the TTY number is (212) 504-4115. The Center is open 24-hours a day, seven days a week.
       
      Emergency Conditions
      If the problem you report is an emergency (e.g. severe leak, mold, or dangerous structural defect), the Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) will send a uniformed Code Enforcement Inspector to the apartment to verify the reported conditions. The inspector will then provide the tenant with the following materials:
      A summary of issued violations
      A complaint number
      The date of inspection
      The inspector\'s badge number
      Brochures outlining the tenant’s rights and responsibilities and the most common health and safety violations issued by HPD to help the tenant better understand his/her rights and responsibilities.
      The landlord will also be notified of the complaint. If violation conditions are verified by the Inspector, a Notice of Violation will be sent to the landlord instructing him/her to repair the condition. If the landlord fails to correct immediately hazardous conditions, HPD\'s Emergency Repair Program may repair the condition and bill the landlord for the cost of the repairs. Tenants can ask about the status of emergency repair work in their apartments by calling (212) 863-5510.
      
      Taking Further Action against a Landlord
      If the problem persists or the landlord refuses to repair the conditions, a tenant or group of tenants can take direct legal action against the building owner by filing a case with the New York City Housing Court. This is called an HP Action. For more information about HP Actions, please visit the HPD website at http://www.nyc.gov/html/hpd/html/tenants/housing-court-info.shtml.
